For this project, you need to have installed python v: 3.7.9, so the app could work normally, if other version is used, it might have problems in deploy so I highly recommend to use the version 3.7.9, the version of django on the other hand, doesn't present much difference beetwen versions, but y recommend to use django version 3.2.25.

For python you would need to install via python official website, here is the link https://www.python.org/downloads/.

And for django, once python is installed and stablished in your path enviroment, use this command in command shell:

>> python -m pip install Django

The first step for the django implement is to install a virtual enviroment that be compatible with the python version, for this, in command shell execute:

>> python3 -m venv venv

If you have some problems finding the env path, in visual studio code open (ctrl + shift + p) and select the env that is adecuate to python version 3.7.9.
